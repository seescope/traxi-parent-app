# traxi-parent-app

## Introduction

This is where our users first meet traxi. By following an ad, or being referred by a friend, they install traxi-parent-app on their device, hoping to start monitoring their children.

The parent app serves two primary purposes:

### Setting up their child's device

The first thing a user (or *parent*, as we'll refer to them from now on) does after installing traxi is to set up their child's device. This is a bit of a complex process that involves a couple of different steps:

1. Entering in their child's name and picture
2. Getting their child's device, then navigating to www.mytraxi.com
3. Entering in a PIN that we specify in the app
4. Following instructions given to them in the app
5. Celebrating, now that their child's device is monitored

So how does the setup process actually work? We'll get in to that later.

### Monitoring their child's device

Once a parent has succesfully set up their device, they can now begin monitoring their child's activity using traxi-parent-app (or just simply *the Parent App*).

By tapping on the picture of their child and then the day of the week they're interested, a parent can see what we refer to as the *DayView*. This page shows the parent:

- How much time their child has used their device late at night
- How much time their child has used their device that day
- How much time their child has spent on Social Media that day

And **most importantly**

- What apps their child used during the day
